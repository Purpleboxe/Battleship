## Conclusion

This project was built for The Odin Project. This project was hard in the beginning for me but I eventually got the hang of it. I wanted to test out a linter so I decided to try out ESLint to make my code more readable. This project is my variation of the game Battleship created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I'm proud of what I made and if you decide to play it and test it out I want you to try and beat the computer. I have had a hard time beating the computer myself! Anyways have fun and thanks for checking out my project!
